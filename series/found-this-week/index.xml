The title of this series is an overt nod to the famous series This Week&amp;rsquo;s Finds written by the inimitable John Baez. I have learned a great deal from that series and his book on gravity, and have the utmost admiration for Baez' abilities as a physicist and communicator. It is my hope that this series will be found useful by some, insightful by at least a few, and accessible by many.</description></item></channel></rss>
