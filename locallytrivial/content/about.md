#### A Little About Me

The profound connection between physics and mathematics is a guiding light for me. Underlying seemingly disparate fields of the natural sciences, these common mathematical structures possess a sublime power and precision, especially when coupled with computational methods. My goal is to truly understand them, employ them, and enjoy the ride.

Presently, I'm a [Mildred Dresselhaus Graduate Fellow](https://science.psu.edu/future-students/graduate-students/science-achievement-graduate-fellowship/2020-2021-recipients/mildred-dresselhaus-graduate-scholarship-in-physics)
at Penn State University studying theoretical physics, and working in the [Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos](http://www.gravity.psu.edu/). Before grad school, I worked for a while as a quantative developer and researcher at an asset management firm, specializing in medium-frequency, distributed signal analysis frameworks. For undergrad, I spent time at both the U.S. Naval Academy and the University of Texas at Austin, studying nonlinear dynamical systems and cosmology.

#### Research Interests

My research interests broadly include classical and quantum gravity. Specifically, I focus on gravitational wave detection methods using information geometry. I am a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://roster.ligo.org/roster.php?do=member&uid=6316&search=name&target=in&order=).

I am also interested in naturally discrete approaches to quantum gravity, including canonical quantum gravity (loops), covariant spinfoams, causal dynamical triangulations, and noncommutative geometry, with an emphasis on computational methods.

Often, I find myself venturing into pure mathematical subjects, usually motivated by physical applications. Topics largely include commutative and noncommutative algebras, differential geometry, and information geometry. I co-founded a seminar series at Penn State, [Mathematical Aspects of Physics Seminar, "MAP Chat"](https://mapchat.science.psu.edu), as a way to share this interest with the community.
