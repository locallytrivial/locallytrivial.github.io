After completing the first year of graduate school (post on the industry $\to$ grad school transition forthcoming), I've
finally got time to reboot the blog, with more focus. I'll be posting on a $\sim$weekly basis about the interesting topics I come across in the course of research, class, and 
general academic meandering. Renewed areas of focus will include various mathematical, physical, or programming topics, 
such as:

- Unravelling bundles (as in fibre bundles)
- Wormhole solutions in GR and energy conditions
- Managing environments in Python and developer workflows

<br>
I will also attempt some recurring installations, such as:

- _Fermi Figures_ - playful posts about solving various back-of-the-envelope questions 
- _Enthralling Theorem_ - spotlight of an interesting theorem / mathematical fact
- _Found this week_ - weekly interesting discoveries, clearly and heavily inspired by the famous 
["This week's finds"](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html) - an asymptote I only hope to approach over time. 

<br>
Please [subscribe](/pages/subscribe) if you like what you find, and feel free to 
[suggest](mailto:jwkennington.web@psu.edu?subject=Blog%20Post%20Suggestion) topics for future posts 

Also, the recommended [physics](/texts-physics) and [maths](/texts-math) references pages have been 
thoroughly updated (they were quite stale).
