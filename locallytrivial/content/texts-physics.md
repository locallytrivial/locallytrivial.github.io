<br>

### Classical Mechanics
<hr>

##### [Taylor -_Classical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2DOKHFb) (I)

Great undergraduate reference text, usually seen in an upper-division undergraduate mechanics course.

##### [Thornton, Marion -  _Classical Dynamics_](https://amzn.to/2VcPYB3) (M)

Undergraduate level classical mechanics text, more advanced than Taylor.

##### [Goldstein - _Classical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2Jh4iRR) (A)

The standard graduate-level text on mechanics.

##### [Arnold - _Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2Lnp7hn) (A)

Mathematical tools for classical mechanics. Notation is a bit old (and Russian), for instance $[A, B]$ is used for
the vector cross product instead of $A \times B$.

##### [Libermann, Marle - _Symplectic Geometry and Analytical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/3EbwSOz) (A)

Excellent reprint of a text that analyses the symplectic structure of classical mechanics. Insofar as classical mechanics
is truly geometry of phase space - this text presents a rigorous treatment of symplectic forms, spaces, and how they relate
to Hamiltonian systems. Very rigorous.

<br>

### Electricity & Magnetism
<hr>

##### [Griffiths - _Introduction to Electrodynamics_](https://amzn.to/2LjSvF7) (I)

Standard undergraduate level text on E&M, frequently used for upper-division courses on electricity and magnetism.
Interestingly, doesn't include much on circuits.

##### [Jackson - _Classical Electrodynamics_](https://amzn.to/2PO7rdk) (A)

The standard graduate text on E&M, a rite of passage.

##### [Baylis - _Electrodynamics: A Modern Geometric Approach_](https://amzn.to/3z4WyIU) (A)

Interesting advanced text that analyses the geometric implications of EM theory, including deriving the Minkowski
metric from the Clifford algebra. Draws really nice connections between special relativity and Maxwell's equations.

##### [Hehl - _Foundations of Classical Electrodynamics_](https://amzn.to/3kaRMWl) (A)

Excellent advanced reference on the detailed mathematical structure of electromagnetic theory, including exterior
algebras and metric-free examination of Maxwell-Lorentz spacetime relations. Strong emphasis placed on axiomatic
approach, considerable rigor.

##### [Scheck - _Classical Field Theory: On Electrodynamics, Non-Abelian Gauge Theories and Gravitation_](https://amzn.to/3EbwzDp) (A)

Interesting advanced text that analyses Maxwell's equations as an example of a gauge theory, then develops generalized
notions of gauge theory. Considers applications to gravity along the lines Weyl considered in the early days of GR.

<br>

### Classical Gravity (GR)
<hr>

##### [Carroll - _Spacetime and Geometry_](https://amzn.to/2DN31hL) (I)

Clean, modern reference that is relatively self-contained. Builds the essential differential geometry (quickly) before
introducing gravitational concepts. Notation is very close to modern mathematical literature.

##### [Schutz - _A First Course In General Relativity_](https://amzn.to/2VJ03VM) (I)

Less modern introductory text to GR, worth reading after / with Carroll.

##### [Wald - _General Relativity_](https://amzn.to/2LldLu7) (M)

Standard graduate level introduction to GR. Excellent exposition of mathematical aspects of GR with a medium amount
of rigor. Does not discuss bundles, and only briefly mentions tetrads.

##### [Poisson - _Gravity_](https://amzn.to/2Jg7xsX) (M)

Moderately advanced text covering details of Newtonian, Post-Newtonian approximation methods.

##### [Poisson - _A Relativist's Toolkit_](https://amzn.to/2H262gr) (A)

Advanced techniques for applying GR to astrophysical situations, assumes a working knowledge of GR.

##### [Misner, Thornton, Wheeler (MTW) - _Gravitation_](https://amzn.to/2H0Tm9F) (A)

Standard reference text, absolutely massive. Includes the most detail on the most topics out of any book on the subject,
and is a useful reference for practitioners.

##### [Straumann - _General Relativity_](https://amzn.to/3leLNz2) (A)

Great supplement reference at the graduate level. Shows full derivations of Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, has great
discussion on black hole thermodynamics. Also includes material of Cartan structure of the field equations and affine
connections.

##### [Geroch - _General Relativity: 1972 Lecture Notes_](https://amzn.to/2XaF1lV) (A)

Geroch is a master. These lecture notes, while brief, expertly weave the mathematics and physics from a spacetime-first
perspective using a wealth of visuals. Geroch shows how physical phenomena can be explained first in spacetime, then
decomposed into space + time to recover familiar quantities.

##### [Chandrasekhar - _The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes_](https://amzn.to/3k5w59X) (A)

One of the most rigorous treatises on black holes in existence, with pages upon pages of calculations. Excellent
introduction to tetrad formalism as well as Newman-Penrose formalism. Covers basically any topic in black holes imaginable,
including derivations / construction of Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and Kerr solutions, perturbations and
effect on electromagnetic phenomena.


<br>

### Numerical Relativity (NR)
<hr>

##### [Baumgarte - _Numerical Relativity_](https://amzn.to/2DNEyci) (M)

Clean, modern introduction to NR, briefly reviews GR but most focus is on numerical considerations.

##### [Alcubierre - _Introduction to 3 + 1 Numerical Relativity_](https://amzn.to/3A9xbXO) (A)

Standard, in-depth reference on numerical relativity.


<br>


### Quantum Gravity (QG)
<hr>

##### [Baez - _Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity_](https://amzn.to/2Xd7wis) (I)

If you can read one introductory book on gravity, make it this book. Baez has the unique ability to present enough detail
to give the interested reader a foothold in related mathematical subjects while staying high-level enough to provide
a coherent overview of the many related fields that appear in quantum gravity. Introduces vector field functional
formalism, gauge fields and relations to local symmetries, elements of knot theory including crossings and windings,
and how these apply to (loop) quantum gravity.

##### [Pullin - _A First Course in Loop Quantum Gravity_](https://amzn.to/3hqTsZP) (I)

A friendly introduction to LQG that doesn't assume prior familiarity with either GR or QFT. While this book doesn't
go into a great deal of depth, it provides a concise, high-level view of what loop quantum gravity is and how it
fits into the landscape of theoretical physics.

##### [Rovelli - _Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity_](https://amzn.to/2WnIZBV) (M)

A high-level text that introduces more detailed structure than the text above; however, this is mostly a summary for
new researchers in the field that have some familiarity with LQG. Carlo's inimitable style makes this an enjoyable read.

##### [Rovelli - _Quantum Gravity_](https://amzn.to/3hk5jZJ) (M)

Graduate level text on loop quantum gravity; the starting point for any serious reading into LQG. Jumps pretty quickly
past the GR essentials and into the tetrad formalism, introduces the concept of spin networks, intertwiners.

##### [Ashtekar - _Lectures on Non-Perturbative Canonical Gravity_](https://amzn.to/3nlPu8J) (M)

Excellent set of lecture notes from the eponymous discoverer of the spinorial formulation of GR. These are a must-have
for any LQG reader.

##### [Thiemann - _Modern Canonical Quantum General Relativity_](https://amzn.to/3EcBOmc) (A)

The rigorous complement to Rovelli, a monolithic volume of mathematical detail. Discusses details of spaces of connections,
bundle structures, and other aspects of the mathematical details of LQG.

##### [Gambini, Pullin - _Loops, Knots, Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity_](https://amzn.to/3twQaZQ) (A)

Excellent, detailed reference for loop representations with applications to gauge theories and lattice techniques. Discusses
applications to gravity including braid theories. Predates Rovelli and Thiemann, so final chapter is mostly interesting
for understanding development of the current theory.


<br>

### Mathematical Physics
<hr>

##### [Jeevanjee - _An Introduction to Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists_](https://amzn.to/3k0lSvw) (I)

Excellent introduction to the theory of groups and tensors, aimed at physics students. Self contained, Jeevanjee (properly)
introduces tensors as multilinear maps, and derives all the familiar behavior including transformation "rules" and index
mechanics. Introduces key concepts from Lie theory with just-enough rigor to prepare reader for further study, includes
many examples from physics including SU(2), SO(3) and others. Introduces representations in a clear way as well. Cannot
recommend highly enough.

##### [Isham - _Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists_](https://amzn.to/2VyDsNA) (I)

The lecture notes of a course taught by a renowned expert in quantum gravity on the mathematical preliminaries for
classical gravity. Includes the standard intro to differential geometry; however, Isham also includes an excellent
exposition of connections and bundles (which is usually missing from such texts). Isham also includes multiple perspectives
on elementary definitions, unifying the various methods by which these concepts are conventionally introduced.

##### [Arfken - _Mathematical Methods for Physicists_](https://amzn.to/2DOLNk7) (I)

Standard reference text at the undergraduate level for mathematical methods. Has many examples of each technique introduced,
but doesn't introduce certain topics from the graduate level such as integral regularization.

##### [Balakrishnan - _Mathematical Physics: Applications and Problems_](https://amzn.to/392b49Y) (M)

Graduate level reference on mathematical methods from a renowned author of mathematical physics books. Goes into more
depth than Arfken (as expected), including functional analysis, operators and algebras. Covers distributional derivatives.

##### [Rudolph, Schmidt - _Differential Geometry and Mathematical Physics: Part I. Manifolds, Lie Groups and Hamiltonian Systems_](https://amzn.to/2YNMsQm) (A)

Great, verbose reference for differential geometry and applications to physics. The first part covers manifolds and elementary lie theory
with applications to Lagrangian mechanics.

##### [Rudolph, Schmidt - _Differential Geometry and Mathematical Physics: Part II. Fibre Bundles, Topology and Gauge Fields_](https://amzn.to/3hptFkO) (A)

Second volume of a great reference on differential geometry, covering aspects that are often missing from gravitation texts
including fiber and principal bundles, Clifford algebras and spin geometry, and gauge theory.

<br>

### Quantum Mechanics
<hr>


##### [Griffiths - _Introduction to Quantum Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2DOAMiT) (I)

Ubiquitous undergraduate text on quantum mechanics, covering the standard sequence of "shutup and calculate" quantum
mechanics. Wavefunctions, some (unfortunately Copenhagen) interpretation, simple potentials, and basic properties
of quantum systems. New edition has a chapter about symmetries and conserved quantities,
a nice introduction to Noethers theorem.

##### [Cohen-Tannoudjhi - _Quantum Mechanics_]() (M)

Three volume series at the graduate level on all aspects of quantum mechanics. Incredibly thorough, Cohen shows details
that are omitted from most other quantum mechanics texts. The many supplemental chapters work through examples that
bring a higher degree of clarity to QM topics. Volumes I and II cover standard graduate level quantum mechanics, formalism
and simple potentials, angular momentum and algebraic implications,


##### [Shankar - _Principles of Quantum Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2VHqfA5) (M)

Intermediate reference text on the mathematical aspects of quantum mechanics. Still focused largely on particle-based
non-relativistic systems. More rigorous references included in "Quantum Theory" section below.


##### [Feynman and Hibbs - _Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals_](https://amzn.to/2Y3TSsV) (A)

Accessible introduction to the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics from the inimitable Feynman (who created
the path integral approach).


##### [Sakurai - _Modern Quantum Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2WiTnL8) (A)

Included for completeness, a standard graduate-level text. Much more terse than Cohen. The author only wrote the first three
chapters, then the rest of the text was written posthumously from lecture notes by collaborators - I include this detail
because it explains why the first three chapters are the best in the book - formalism, dynamics, and angular momentum. The
remaining material I would recommend sourcing elsewhere.



<br>

### Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
<hr>

##### [Zee - _Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell_](https://amzn.to/2LAQ5Cj) (M)

Approachable introduction in a relaxed style, Zee provides a clear presentation of QFT essentials.

##### [Peskin, Shroeder - _An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_](https://amzn.to/3A8iZ1o) (M)

The standard, graduate level reference used in QFT courses.

##### [DeWitt - _The Global Approach to Quantum Field Theory_](https://amzn.to/3k2pyNe) (A)

Insightful two-volume set taking a unique approach to developing QFT.

##### [Weinberg - _The Quantum Theory of Fields_](https://amzn.to/391bltK) (A)

Standard rigorous reference on QFT.

Set of advanced lectures from a renowned elucidator of QFT.

<br>

### Quantum Theory - eg. Foundations, Formalism
<hr>

##### [Norsen - _Foundations of Quantum Mechanics: An Exploration of the Physical Meaning of Quantum Theory_](https://amzn.to/3E96yos) (I)

Accessible introduction to a field often omitted from the standard physics education - interpreting quantum theory. Norsen presents
the main interpretations, Copenhagen, Many Worlds, Bohmian, Spontaneous Collapse. Excellently introduces ontological considerations
as well as the measurement problem.

##### [Woit - _Quantum Theory, Groups and Representations: An Introduction_](https://amzn.to/3Eced59) (A)

Rigorous, unconventional approach to developing quantum theory. Woit eschews the standard approach of introducing classical
systems first, then 'quantising' these systems with bad analogies. Instead, Woit develops intuition around the algebraic
nature of quantum theory using examples that have no classical analogues. Excellent text with unique perspective.

##### [Hall - _Quantum Theory for Mathematicians_](https://amzn.to/3leLLam) (A)

Rigorous introduction to quantum theory aimed at mathematicians, using a Hilbert-space approach. Covers the role of Lie
theory in quantum mechanics as well as a more rigorous presentation of path integrals.

##### [Landsman - _Foundations of Quantum Theory: From Classical Concepts to Operator Algebras_](https://amzn.to/3tzTxzg) (A)

Detailed (read: thick) exposition of operator algebras and the connection to classical Poisson structures.

<br>

### Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
<hr>

I've not found a thermo book that included everything satisfactorily, but below are some that I've used in various courses.

##### [Schroeder - _Introduction to Thermal Physics_](https://amzn.to/2VECzkP) (I)

Standard undergraduate thermodynamics book.

##### [Kardar - _Statistical Physics of Particles_](https://amzn.to/3tyY5FU) (M)

Clear, concise statistical mechanics and thermodynamics book at the graduate level. Derives the laws of thermodynamics in an
abstract setting, includes several unique derivations (some are probably worth skipping).

##### [Kardar - _Statistical Physics of Fields_](https://amzn.to/3tAoPpR) (A)

Follow up volume to the one above, excellent discussion of Landau principles.

##### [Balakishnan - _Elements of Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2DNnUcC) (M)

Great reference on nonequilibrium systems and their statistical properties.

##### [Berlinsky, Harris - _Statistical Mechanics: An Introductory Graduate Course_](https://amzn.to/3hqGueD) (A)

Graduate level text focusing on more mathematical aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, including
the renormalization group, Landau theory and mean field theory. Many examples considered including superconductivity
and quantum fluids.
