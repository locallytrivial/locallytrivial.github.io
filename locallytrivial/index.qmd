## Mathematical Physics & Geometric Signal Processing

I am a researcher bridging the gap between **General Relativity** and **Statistical Signal Processing**.

My work addresses a critical bottleneck in the next generation of gravitational wave astronomy: standard filtering techniques (like Matched Filtering) rely on Euclidean noise geometries. However, real astrophysical data is often non-stationary and non-Gaussian, creating "curvature" in the signal space that degrades detection.

To solve this, I develop **Gauge Theoretic Signal Processing (GTSP)**. By treating signal noise as a connection on a fiber bundle, I construct "parallel transport" operators that allow for robust detection even when the underlying noise statistics drift.

### Core Research Areas

* **GTSP:** Invariant signal representations for high-noise environments.
* **Tests of General Relativity:** Observational signatures of topological solitons (wormholes) and exotic compact objects.
* **Geometric Learning:** Embedding physics-based symmetries into deep learning architectures.
