  abstract = {GstLAL is a stream-based matched-filtering search pipeline aiming at the prompt discovery of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences such as the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. Over the past three observation runs by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, the GstLAL search pipeline has participated in several tens of gravitational wave discoveries. The fourth observing run (O4) is set to begin in May 2023 and is expected to see the discovery of many new and interesting gravitational wave signals which will inform our understanding of astrophysics and cosmology. We describe the current configuration of the GstLAL low-latency search and show its readiness for the upcoming observation run by presenting its performance on a mock data challenge. The mock data challenge includes 40 days of LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo strain data along with an injection campaign in order to fully characterize the performance of the search. We find an improved performance in terms of detection rate and significance estimation as compared to that observed in the O3 online analysis. The improvements are attributed to several incremental advances in the likelihood ratio ranking statistic computation and the method of background estimation.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a new geometric method for fast template placement for searches for gravitational waves from the inspiral, merger and ringdown of compact binaries. The method is based on a binary tree decomposition of the template bank parameter space into non-overlapping hypercubes. We use a numerical approximation of the signal overlap metric at the center of each hypercube to estimate the number of templates required to cover the hypercube and determine whether to further split the hypercube. As long as the expected number of templates in a given cube is greater than a given threshold, we split the cube along its longest edge according to the metric. When the expected number of templates in a given hypercube drops below this threshold, the splitting stops and a template is placed at the center of the hypercube. Using this method, we generate aligned-spin template banks covering the mass range suitable for a search of Advanced LIGO data. The aligned-spin bank required \textasciitilde 24 CPU-hours and produced 2 million templates. In general, we find that other methods, namely stochastic placement, produces a more strictly bounded loss in match between waveforms, with the same minimal match between waveforms requiring about twice as many templates with our proposed algorithm. Though we note that the average match is higher, which would lead to a higher detection efficiency. Our primary motivation is not to strictly minimize the number of templates with this algorithm, but rather to produce a bank with useful geometric properties in the physical parameter space coordinates. Such properties are useful for population modeling and parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {Matched-filtering searches for gravitational-wave signals from compact binary mergers employ template banks which are a collection of modeled waveforms described by unique intrinsic parameters. We present two banks designed for low-latency and archive sub-solar mass (SSM) searches in data from the fourth observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, and demonstrate the efficacy of the banks via simulated signals. Further, we introduce a set of modifications to the geometric, manifold algorithm that allow the method to work for exceedingly low component masses necessary for SSM bank production. The archive search bank contains a total of \$3,452,006\$ templates, and covers a mass parameter space of \$0.2\$ to \$10\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ in the larger component and \$0.2\$ to \$1.0\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ in the smaller component, the spin parameter space of \$-0.9\$ to \$0.9\$ for masses above \$0.5\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$-0.1\$ to \$0.1\$ for masses below \$0.5\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, and the mass ratio parameter space of \$1\$ to \$10\$. The PSD used was from a week of the first half of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA, and the low frequency cutoff was set to \$45\$ Hz with a maximum waveform duration of \$128\$ seconds. The bank simulations performed using SBank have shown that the banks presented in this paper have sufficient efficacy for use in their respective searches.},

Our formalism implements several improvements to the low latency calculation of the probability of astrophysical origin\textasciitilde (\textbackslash PASTRO\textbraceleft\textbraceright ), so as to correctly account for various factors such as the sensitivity change between observing runs, and the deviation of the recovered template waveform from the true gravitational wave signal that can strongly bias said calculation. We demonstrate the high accuracy with which our new formalism recovers and classifies gravitational wave triggers, by analyzing replay data from previous observing runs injected with simulated sources of different categories. We show that these improvements enable the correct identification of the majority of simulated sources, many of which would have otherwise been misclassified. We carry out the aforementioned analysis by implementing our formalism through the \textbackslash GSTLAL\textbraceleft\textbraceright{} search pipeline even though it can be used in conjunction with potentially any matched filtering pipeline. Armed with robust and self-consistent \textbackslash PASTRO\textbraceleft\textbraceright{} values, the \textbackslash GSTLAL\textbraceleft\textbraceright{} pipeline can be expected to provide accurate source classification information for assisting in multi-messenger follow-up observations to gravitational wave alerts sent out during O4.},

  abstract = {Matched-filtering gravitational wave search pipelines identify gravitational wave signals by computing correlations, i.e., signal-to-noise ratios, between gravitational wave detector data and gravitational wave template waveforms. Intrinsic parameters, the component masses and spins, of the gravitational wave waveforms are often stored in "template banks", and the construction of a densely populated template bank is essential for some gravitational wave search pipelines. This paper presents a template bank that is currently being used by the GstLAL-based compact binary search pipeline in the fourth observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration, and was generated with a new binary tree approach of placing templates, \textbraceleft\textbackslash fontfamily\textbraceleft qcr\textbraceright\textbackslash selectfont manifold\textbraceright. The template bank contains \$1.8 \textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum 6\$ sets of template parameters covering plausible neutron star and black hole systems up to a total mass of \$400\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ with component masses between \$1\$-\$200\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and mass ratios between \$1\$ and \$20\$ under the assumption that each component object's angular momentum is aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We validate the template bank generated with our new method, \textbraceleft\textbackslash fontfamily\textbraceleft qcr\textbraceright\textbackslash selectfont manifold\textbraceright, by comparing it with a template bank generated with the previously used stochastic template placement method. We show that both template banks have similar effectualness. The \textbraceleft\textbackslash fontfamily\textbraceleft qcr\textbraceright\textbackslash selectfont GstLAL\textbraceright{} search pipeline performs singular value decomposition (SVD) on the template banks to reduce the number of filters used. We describe a new grouping of waveforms that improves the computational efficiency of SVD by nearly \$5\$ times as compared to previously reported SVD sorting schemes.},

  abstract = {The global network of gravitational-wave observatories now includes five detectors, namely LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, KAGRA, and GEO 600. These detectors collected data during their third observing run, O3, composed of three phases: O3a starting in April of 2019 and lasting six months, O3b starting in November of 2019 and lasting five months, and O3GK starting in April of 2020 and lasting 2 weeks. In this paper we describe these data and various other science products that can be freely accessed through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center at https://gwosc.org. The main dataset, consisting of the gravitational-wave strain time series that contains the astrophysical signals, is released together with supporting data useful for their analysis and documentation, tutorials, as well as analysis software packages.},

  abstract = {Despite the growing number of confident binary black hole coalescences observed through gravitational waves so far, the astrophysical origin of these binaries remains uncertain. Orbital eccentricity is one of the clearest tracers of binary formation channels. Identifying binary eccentricity, however, remains challenging due to the limited availability of gravitational waveforms that include effects of eccentricity. Here, we present observational results for a waveform-independent search sensitive to eccentric black hole coalescences, covering the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We identified no new high-significance candidates beyond those that were already identified with searches focusing on quasi-circular binaries. We determine the sensitivity of our search to high-mass (total mass \$M{$>$}70\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$) binaries covering eccentricities up to 0.3 at 15 Hz orbital frequency, and use this to compare model predictions to search results. Assuming all detections are indeed quasi-circular, for our fiducial population model, we place an upper limit for the merger rate density of high-mass binaries with eccentricities \$0 {$<$} e \textbackslash leq 0.3\$ at \$0.33\$ Gpc\$\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -3\textbraceright\$ yr\$\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -1\textbraceright\$ at 90\textbackslash\% confidence level.},

  abstract = {Among the various candidates for dark matter (DM), ultralight vector DM can be probed by laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors through the measurement of oscillating length changes in the arm cavities. In this context, KAGRA has a unique feature due to differing compositions of its mirrors, enhancing the signal of vector DM in the length change in the auxiliary channels. Here we present the result of a search for \$U(1)\_\textbraceleft B-L\textbraceright\$ gauge boson DM using the KAGRA data from auxiliary length channels during the first joint observation run together with GEO600. By applying our search pipeline, which takes into account the stochastic nature of ultralight DM, upper bounds on the coupling strength between the \$U(1)\_\textbraceleft B-L\textbraceright\$ gauge boson and ordinary matter are obtained for a range of DM masses. While our constraints are less stringent than those derived from previous experiments, this study demonstrates the applicability of our method to the lower-mass vector DM search, which is made difficult in this measurement by the short observation time compared to the auto-correlation time scale of DM.},

  abstract = {Starting from May 2023, the LIGO Scientific, Virgo and KAGRA Collaboration is planning to conduct the fourth observing run with improved detector sensitivities and an expanded detector network including KAGRA. Accordingly, it is vital to optimize the detection algorithm of low-latency search pipelines, increasing their sensitivities to gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences. In this work, we discuss several new features developed for ranking statistics of GstLAL-based inspiral pipeline, which mainly consist of: the signal contamination removal, the bank-\$\textbackslash xi\textasciicircum 2\$ incorporation, the upgraded \$\textbackslash rho-\textbackslash xi\textasciicircum 2\$ signal model and the integration of KAGRA. An injection study demonstrates that these new features improve the pipeline's sensitivity by approximately 15\% to 20\%, paving the way to further multi-messenger observations during the upcoming observing run.},
