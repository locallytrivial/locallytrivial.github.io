Due to the extreme tidal forces experienced along such a path, the observer would be stretched out - a process colloquially referred to as spaghettification. This week I would like to look at a happier use for spaghetti near blackholes. If an observer in a stable circular orbit around the supermassive blackhole at the center of our galaxy were to use spaghetti as a tether, how much spaghetti would be required?</description></item><item><title>Fermi Problem: Baseball Blackhole</title><link>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/fermi-friday-20210924/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jameswkennington@psu.edu (Jim Kennington)</author><guid>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/fermi-friday-20210924/</guid><description>The question of interest this week is:
If all baseballs ever used in an MLB game were compressed into a blackhole, how large would the blackhole be?
To estimate the blackhole radius $r_{BH}$, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to compute the number of baseballs used in MLB games, translate that number to a total mass, then compute the blackhole radius of the corresponding mass.
Counting Baseballs We begin with a lower-bound on the number of baseballs used in all MLB games.</description></item><item><title>Found This Week #1</title><link>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/ftw-20210919/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jameswkennington@psu.edu (Jim Kennington)</author><guid>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/ftw-20210919/</guid><description>As this is the inaugural issue of the found-this-week series, I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly note my motivation and inspiration. The title of this series is an overt nod to the famous series This Week&amp;rsquo;s Finds written by the inimitable John Baez. I have learned a great deal from that series and his book on gravity, and have the utmost admiration for Baez&amp;rsquo; abilities as a physicist and communicator. It is my hope that this series will be found useful by some, insightful by at least a few, and accessible by many.</description></item><item><title>Fermi Problem: A Different Manhattan Project</title><link>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/fermi-friday-20210917/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jameswkennington@psu.edu (Jim Kennington)</author><guid>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/fermi-friday-20210917/</guid><description>For this week&amp;rsquo;s installment of Fermi estimation, the question of interest is:
How fast would the sun burn an amount of hydrogen equivalent to the above-ground mass of Manhattan?
To estimate the burn-time we&amp;rsquo;ll need to guess at a few quantities: the above-ground mass of Manhattan, the solar luminosity (total energy emitted from the sun), and fraction of energy emitted from the core of the sun that makes it to the surface.</description></item><item><title>Gravity of a Photon</title><link>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/gravity-em-field/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jameswkennington@psu.edu (Jim Kennington)</author><guid>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/gravity-em-field/</guid><description>A friend, who focuses primarily on experimental particle physics, recently asked me an interesting question about gravity. Specifically, he asked how the presence of electromagnetic fields impacts the gravitational field. Applying some modern-physics reasoning, he proposed that electromagnetic fields should exert gravitational influence because photons have momentum that can be viewed as mass in special relativity, and should interact gravitationally. I found this idea interesting, if a bit interpretive, and answered with the precise formulation of the impact of the electromagnetic field on the curvature tensor.</description></item></channel></rss>
