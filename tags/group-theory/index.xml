This diagram was immensely helpful to me, in that it helped show the relationships between various commonly used objects in mathematical physics. As I&rsquo;ve encountered new structures, I&rsquo;ve attempted to augment this map along two dimensions: a structure dimension that aims to measure the number of attributes an algebraic object has, and a specificity dimension which measures the amount of constraints placed on each attribute.]]></description></item><item><title>Book Review: Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists (Jeevanjee)</title><link>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/book-jeevanjee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jameswkennington@psu.edu (Jim Kennington)</author><guid>http://locallytrivial.com/posts/book-jeevanjee/</guid><description>Summary I picked up a copy of Nadir Jeevnajee&amp;rsquo;s An Introduction to Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists a few months ago with the intent of skimming through and spending most of my time in reference texts. To my pleasant surprise, I found this text to be self contained - requiring little to no references. The presentation is at once mathematically rigorous and physically intuitive, alluding to well-known examples from physics throughout.</description></item></channel></rss>
