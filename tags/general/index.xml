I&rsquo;ll be posting on a $\sim$weekly basis about the interesting topics I come across in the course of research, class, and general academic meandering. Renewed areas of focus will include various mathematical, physical, or programming topics, such as:
 Unravelling bundles (as in fibre bundles) Wormhole solutions in GR and energy conditions Managing environments in Python and developer workflows   Fermi Figures - playful posts about solving various back-of-the-envelope questions Enthralling Theorem - spotlight of an interesting theorem / mathematical fact Found this week - weekly interesting discoveries, clearly and heavily inspired by the famous &ldquo;This week&rsquo;s finds&rdquo; - an asymptote I only hope to approach over time.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
