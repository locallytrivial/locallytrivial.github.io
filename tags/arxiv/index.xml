However, I find it difficult to keep track of all the new papers that are posted each day. I have explored many of the existing tools for tracking ArXiv, but I have not found one that meets my simple requirements. All I wanted was a tool that would let me configure a set of queries, and send me period emails with the new papers that match those queries.</description></item></channel></rss>
